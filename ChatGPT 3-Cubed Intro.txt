Business leaders are continously looking for ways to increase cost efficiency, improve customer experience and increase controls effectiveness. However, they tend to solve for these objectives sequentially, while what they need is answers that address these together.  To solve these objectives, they are supported by internal teams, each of which are focussed on different aspects of the operations.  These include process, risk, operations, finance, IT and talent.  Again, rather than come together to solve the objectives holistically, each of the functions uses its own tools and techniques, more often than not resulting in competing recommendations.  As each of these recommendations is implemented, there is a need for operations resources.  

Here are some statistics on the market situation.  50% companies report their business model has changed or is changing 40% executives seek cost as benefit, 35% seek client experience and 38% seek control 91% businesses are involved in transformation, with 87% prioritizing digital 50% businesses prioritizing transformation don’t have a dedicated team 25% companies doing transformation don’t have an overall strategy 74% is the reported failure rate for large-scale transformations 

3-cubed is a unique SaaS platform that helps senior leadership optimize their operations. 
Optimize means that 3-Cubed understands that operations need to meet cost efficiency, customer experience, and control effectiveness goals. Traditional transformation finds answers for one goal at a time. 3-cubed on the other hand, uses design thinking to help senior management solve simultaneously for all three objectives. 

Operations means that in order optimize all goals you need to look at operations holistically across all functions.  These functions are process, risk, operational capacity, finance, IT, and talent. We call these the PROFIT levers. While traditional transformation uses the tools and techniques for one lever at a time. 3-cubed algorithms provide augmented intelligence for the solution architect by finding all the issues across PROFIT and can provide functional and functional and cross-functional ideas to resolve each of these issues. 

3-Cubed refers to 3 parts to operations optimization. The first cube is strategy, or the goals we want to meet. The second cube is the functions that support that strategy, or the PROFIT functions. The third cube stands for initiatives that implement the changes suggested by the previous cubes. All three need to be in synch for optimal operations.

Because 3-Cubed focuses on objectives to optimize, we say that it uses design thinking to solve a goals-oriented that is knotty and traditionally iterative.  Because it uses all operational levers to do so, and this is often beyond the expertise of any individual, we say it uses augmented intelligence providing the user with all the facts and the analyses but leaving the decision to the user.

To do the above, 3-Cubed builds a digital twin of the operations using a structured 6-step approach. We call this the 6-I framework, and it encompasses the following steps: 
1. Intent: Where senior management defines what constitutes success - essentially translating their required score card into the relevant cost, control, and client metrics they wish to achieve. 
2. Information: Where business analysts provide structured, readily available information to 3-cubed on the state of their current operations, so 3-cubed can create a digital twin of the operations. 3-cubed is agnostic to the source of this information that can be provided through Excel, Visio, BPMN, or XML. 3-cubed does not need to link up to native applications to get this information, nor does it demand perfect information.  A built-in reconciliation engine detects data anomalies and throws them up for rectification. 
3. Issues: Based on the Information provided to the digital twin, 3-cubed computes all the cost, client, and control metrics that the operation is adhering to and the impact of each metric on other metrics to help analyse the root cause of problems and improvement opportunities. Management can review the metrics first to ascertain the accuracy of the input and then to discover the key issues and what is causing them. 
4. Ideas: Based on the issues selected for resolution, 3-cubed algorithms identify all the functional or cross-functional changes that can be made to improve the metrics. These very detailed ideas are shown to senior leaders for them to select, reject or amend each idea provided. 
5. Impact: Each selected idea is tested for its impact on the operation providing management with clear visibility into the predicted metrics that the idea will generate as well as what each element of PROFIT will look like if the idea is implemented. This allows management to iterate on the ideas selected, add additional ideas or amend ideas to arrive at the specific metrics that they had set out to achieve. Each iteration can then be stored as a “scenario” of the future state, and multiple scenarios show the path to the final solution. 
6. Implementation: For each scenario created, 3-Cubed generates a detailed report on the new process, risk, operations capacity, financials, IT and talent that can be used as a guide to implementation. This plan provides delivery managers with a clear view of the actions they need to take to achieve management goals. It enforces accountability for the relevant delivery teams and enables collaboration to ensure that each idea is prioritized and executed to a plan. 

Our clients are marquee names in BPO, consulting and business. Which means they have an excellent understanding of operations, transformation and access to the different tools and techniques to drive these. Despite this, 3-cubed is consistently able to generate results that are 30% better, in 1/3 of the time, and with 3-times more assurance than through traditional transformation. 
A. It is better because its algorithms are able to identify all the issues and suggest all the ideas for optimization that would otherwise get missed out by teams or techniques that focus on a single objective or a single operations lever at a time. 
B. It is faster because of structured process for information, analysis and the power of computing in generating the 360-degree view of the operations and finding the impact of ideas on these metrics. 
C. It is more assured because its impact engine is able to identify any unidentified consequences. In addition, as a digital twin it is always able to quickly provide the best next action in case of implementation challenges or changes in the operation.


The key features of the product are:
1. Design thinking because it follows a goal led methodology.
2. Augmented Intelligence, because of the difficulty for the human mind to examine all the interrelationships between PROFIT elements algorithms are the only way to manage this complexity.
3. Structured approach, because it combines design thinking and augmented intelligence into a repeatable, scalable framework to generate results better, faster, and with greater assurance.
The base for these features is the digital twin that 3-Cubed creates and uses.

The primary beneficiaries of 3-Cubed are senior business leaders who are more concerned with designing the right operating model than in transaction level decisions.  3-cubed understands that not all decisions have perfect data and therefore is happy with good enough information or assumptions.  3-Cubed’s ability to provide sensitivity analysis on the obviates the need for real time or perfect data.  3-cubed helps leadership by designing operating models that meet their cost, control, and compliance goals. It uses all PROFIT levers to do so. But each PROFIT lever is managed by a senior executive. Process by the Chief Transformation Officer; Risk by the Chief Risk Officer; Operations by the Chief Operations Officer; Finance by the Chief Financial Officer; IT by the Chief Technology Officer; and Teams by the Head of Human Resources. All these roles report into the Chief Executive Officer who decides what the business goals are for cost, control and customer experience. The CEO or is normally the business sponsor and the capability usually rests with the COO organization, though the other members play supporting and influencing roles in the design and implementation of the optimized operations.

Users: 
Any 3-Cubed project (the 6 stages) has the following participants:
(a) the business sponsor oversees all goals and has all functions report to her. 
(b) the capability owner is responsible for deploying 3-cubed across operations that need optimization and coordinating the results. 
(c) the solution architect is responsible for using 3-cubed and coming up with impactful ideas for improvement and implementation. 
(d) the business analyst is responsible for building the 3-cubed model by providing and validating the information. 
(e) the process owner is responsible for day-to-day management of process and is the repository of the information required to build the model. 
(f) The delivery leader manages multiple process owners so inherits some of their concerns but has a larger goal of ensuring their operations meet the need of all stakeholders (goals). She manages Process and Operations directly, but often need allies from Risk, Finance, IT and Teams heads to achieve these objectives. 


3-Cubed is industry, geography, process, or goals agnostic. There are over 1000 operations where 3-Cubed has been used, covering financial services, insurance, healthcare, enterprise services, technology, social media, manufacturing companies across the globe across front office, middle office and back-office functions. 

The key benefit of the 3-cubed digital twin lies in the 360-degree perspective of operations it provides. Traditionally, this type of analysis was provided by management consultants.  However, this alternative tends to be manual, time-consuming and expensive.  Management consultants are also focused on specific functions and there is a limited ability to provide answers that span process, risk, operations, finance, IT and talent.  In the recent past, there have been many point solutions for each function.  For example process mining focuses on process and automation; compliance planners focus on risk management; workforce management tools focus on process, operations capacity; financial planners and budgeting tools focus on finance and competency tools focus on process and teams.  However, none of these is able to examine the relationship between these functions and unable therefore to identify cross-functional root causes, provide cross-functional ideas to resolve, or perform a 360-degree impact analysis.

We are not consultants, and do not provide traditional management consulting. 3-Cubed does that exceptionally well on its own. We do, however, appreciate that this is new technology, and there our team of product specialists facilitate adoption through training and customer success services.  

3-Cubed is available as a SaaS offering, hosted on AWS. The benefits of doing so are 1. anywhere, anytime access, 2. Plug and play, requires no connectivity with native applications to get started 3. Flexible, subscription-based model 4. Access to the latest algorithms and analytics and product changes 5. Access to the machine learning models for information input. We do offer product support through standard services that include:
