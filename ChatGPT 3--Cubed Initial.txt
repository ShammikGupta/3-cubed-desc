3-cubed is a unique software platform that helps senior leadership optimize their operations.  When we speak about optimizing, 3-Cubed understands that operations need to meet cost efficiency, customer experience, and control effectiveness goals.  Traditional transformation finds answers for one goal at a time.  3-cubed on the other hand, uses design thinking to help senior management solve simultaneously for all three objectives.

In order to do so, it uses all the operating levers available to management.  We use the mnemonic PROFIT for process, risk, operational capacity, finance, IT and talent to describe these operational levers.  While traditional transformation uses the tools and techniques for one lever at a time. 3-cubed algorithms identify all the issues that an operations faces across each of PROFIT and is able to provide functional and cross-functional ideas to resolve these.

In order to do this, 3-Cubed uses a structured 6-step approach.

1. Intent:  Where senior management defines what constitutes success - essentially translating their required score card into the relevant cost, control and client metrics they wish to achieve.
2. Information: Where business analysts provide structured, readily available information to 3-cubed on the state of their current operations, so 3-cubed can create a digital twin of the operations.  3-cubed is agnostic to the source of this information that can be provided through excel,visio,process mining, or workflow.  3-cubed does not need to link up to native applications to get this information.
3. Issues:  Based on the analysis of the digital twin, 3-cubed computes all the cost, client, and control metrics that the operation is adhering to.  Not only does it compute each metric based on the information provided, it also computes the impact of each metric on other metrics to help analyze the root cause of problems and improvement opportunities.  Management can review the metrics first to ascertain the accuracy of the input and then to discover the key issues and what is causing them.
4. Ideas:  Based on the issues selected for resolution, 3-cubed algorithms identify all the functional or cross-functional changes that can be made to improve the metrics. These very detailed ideas are shown to senior leaders for them to select, reject or amend each idea provided.  
5. Impact: Once an idea is selected, or amended, 3-Cubed computes the impact of the idea on future state metrics by changing the information set with the idea incorporated. This allows management to iterate on the ideas selected, add additional ideas or amend ideas to arrive at the specific metrics that they had set out to achieve.  Each iteration can then be stored as a scenario of the future state.
6. Implementation: For each scenario created, 3-Cubed generates a detailed report on the new process, risk, operations capacity, financials, IT and talent that can be used as a guide to implementation.  Along with this detailed set of instructions and the metrics predicted during the impact phase, management has a implementation plan that covers the what and the "so what" of the change required.

Our clients are marquee names in BPO, consulting and business.  Which means they have an excellent understanding of operations, transformation and access to the different tools and techniques to drive these.  Despite this, 3-cubed is consistently able to generate results that are 30% better, in 1/3 of the time, and with 3-times more assurance than through traditional transformation.  

It is better because its algorithms are able to identify all the issues, and suggest all the ideas for optimization that would otherwise get missed out by teams or techniques that focus on a single objective or a single operations lever at a time.

It is faster because of structured process for information, analysis and the power of computing in generating the 360 degree view of the operations and finding the impact of ideas on these metrics.

It is more assured because its impact engine is able to identify any unidentied consequences. In addition, as a digital twin it is always able to quickly provide the best next action in case of implementation challenges or changes in the operation.
