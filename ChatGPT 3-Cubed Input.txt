3-Cubed uses the following information to create a digital twin.  

STAGE 1: Process and Operations Information
a) 	Process Map: A level 3 cross functional process map.  
	1)	3-Cubed uses this as a base for the rest of the information, and to determine who does what with whom and in what order. 
	2) 	We dont need overly details or key-stroke process maps, but its important to capture the relevant teams, variations and decision
	3)	3-Cubed is agnostic to the source of information and has APIs that can read process maps in Visio, BPMN, XML, or Excel formats
b)	Teams Location:  Information on the teams in the process map
	1)	3-Cubed uses this to initialize a global clock on when what work can be scheduled. 
	2) 	The information required is team location; working hours; shift length; if they are humans or machines, in-scope or out of scope.
	3)	The information is entered on a single screen
c)	Systems and Applications:  The software technology that is used in the process
	1)	3-Cubed uses this to determine the forms and business rules use, and to determine the automation potential  
	2) 	The information required is team location; working hours; shift length; if they are humans or machines, in-scope or out of scope.
	3)	The information is entered on a single screen
d)	Product:  Information on the input and output of each activity of the process map
	1)	3-Cubed uses this to ensure that Volume is correctly captured, and to help capture the control objectives 
	2) 	The output of any activiy is the input to the next activity, so the information required is the output of each activity 
	3)	The information context specific, though 3-Cubed provides machine learning support to enter this information
e)	Volume:  The volume of tasks performed by each activity.
	1)	3-Cubed uses this to compute the percentage of rework, rejects and effort. 
	2) 	Provide the starting volume and then the % split at each decision activity so 3-cubed computes the volume for each path
	3)	You can enter the volume based on history, judgment or desired capacity
f)	Average Handle Time: The average time it takes to perform one task of an activity
	1)	3-Cubed uses this to compute the effort of each activity, along with volume 
	2) 	You don't need time and motion studies, guestimates are good enough. 3-Cubed will identify if the data is wildly inaccurate.
	3)	You can provide this information from workflow, process miners, spreadsheets in CSV or Excel formats, or enter it directly

STAGE 2: Team Size and Work Scheduling Information
g)	Periodic Activities: Activities in the process that are not performed daily
	1)	This information is captured so 3-cubed can compute the number of people that are required to manage the periodic workload in addition to daily tasks 
	2) 	Mark out the activities in the process map and provide information on their periodicity, start date(s) and duration
	3)	You can enter the information directly on to the tool. The ability to enter the information via Excel is in the next release.
h)	Teams Size:  The number of people in each team
	1)	3-Cubed uses this to determine the critical path, the cycle time and the overall and peak utilization by team   
	2) 	The information required is number of people in each team, and it cannot be less than the effort for each time divided by the working hours
	3)	The information is entered on a single screen, but can be sourced from various records
i)	Wait Periods: The wait time between two activities because of volume arrival patterns, time taken to respond, or system timing
	1)	3-Cubed uses this to schedule work taking into account the impact these wait times have on availability of the next work item 
	2) 	You can provide wait periods, specify specific times of day, beginning or end of day periods, only for those activities where relevant
	3)	Best to enter this information directly into the tool, though information can be sourced from process miners, workflow or workforce tools
j)	Deadlines: The contractual or policy commitments by when to finish certain activities in the process
	1)	3-Cubed uses this to schedule work taking into account the impact these deadlines have on the people needed to ensure these are met 
	2) 	You can provide either absolute deadlines, irrespective of previous activities or deadlines relative to a previous activity
	3)	Best to enter this information directly into the tool, though information can be sourced contracts, policies or procedure documents

STAGE 3: Qualitative and Context Information
k)	Forms: The kay paper or digital forms that are used for each activity.
	1)	Helps select the business rules and the mode of information flow for automation assessment. 
	2) 	Don't need every form, but the main forms used through the process, but is important to capture how the information flows and the key rules
	3)	The information can be entered via Excel, though 3-Cubed also provides machine learning support to enter this information
l)	Business Rules:  The key fields in the forms or business rules required to perform the activity.  Also if these are fact, computations, or judgment
	1)	Helps in understanding the competency required to perform the activity and therefore team competency, and also type of automation possible
	2) 	Don't need every field, but the main sections, to capture competency and the type of rules the teams need to know
	3)	The information can be entered via Excel, though 3-Cubed also provides machine learning support to enter this information	
m)	Risk and Controls: Control objectives and selection of controls
	1)	Used to understand over or under-control, control effectiveness and the effort spent on control
	2)	Users can select objectives through a library or enter their own objectives.  
	3)	Machine learning identifies existing control activities, but seeks user confirmation and if it a control, asks to map it to the relevant objective(s)
n)	NVA: Aided selection of NVA type activities
	1)	Used to compute effort of non-core activities to reduce effort and critical path
	2)	3-Cubed uses machine learning to identify activities as action, reporting, routing or recording and requests user to confirm classification
	3)	Information entered on a single screen, aided by machine learning	

STAGE 4: Financial Information
p)	Team Salaries: Average salary per team by location
	1)	Along with Team Size, used to compute the total HR cost, and also to assess if salary is commensurate with competency required
	2)	Only requires average team cost, not cost at individual level.  Also asks for benchmark costs for different experience levels  
	3)	Information entered on a single screen, but can be sourced through various internal and job-sites resources
r)	Seat Cost: Cost per seat or component by location
	1)	Used to compute Infrastructure cost along with the results of the sceduling that determines the seats required
	2)	Information can be provided either as a consolidated cost per seat per annum or separated into cost per seat and software cost
	3)	Information entered on a single screen, but can be sourced through budget, pricing or other sources
